# My Journey to Becoming an AI Agent Expert with Google ADK 🚀

## About This Repository
This repository documents my learning journey through Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) crash course. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive learning path from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Basic Concepts ✅
- [x] Setting up the development environment
- [x] Understanding basic agent concepts
- [x] Creating first simple agent
- [x] Exploring agent properties and configurations
- [x] Understanding model integration

### Phase 2: Core Features (In Progress) 🔄
- [x] Building complex agent interactions
- [x] Implementing custom tools and functions
- [ ] Working with different AI models (LiteLLM)
- [x] Creating structured outputs
- [x] Implementing stateful sessions
- [ ] Implementing persistent storage
- [ ] Creating multi-agent systems
- [ ] Building stateful multi-agent systems

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Implementing callbacks
- [ ] Creating sequential agents
- [ ] Building parallel agents
- [ ] Developing loop agents
- [ ] Understanding agent evaluation metrics

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Future)
- [ ] Building production-ready agents
- [ ] Implementing advanced security measures
- [ ] Creating scalable agent architectures
- [ ] Optimizing agent performance
- [ ] Contributing to the ADK community
