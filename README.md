 # My Journey to Becoming an AI Agent Expert with Google ADK ðŸš€

## About This Repository
This repository documents my learning journey from a beginner to an expert in building AI agents using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). Each day, I'll add new learnings, experiments, and projects to track my progress and share knowledge with the community.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current)
- [x] Setting up the development environment
- [x] Understanding basic agent concepts
- [x] Creating first simple agent
- [ ] Exploring agent properties and configurations
- [ ] Understanding model integration

### Phase 2: Intermediate (Coming Soon)
- [ ] Building complex agent interactions
- [ ] Implementing custom tools and functions
- [ ] Working with different AI models
- [ ] Creating multi-agent systems
- [ ] Understanding agent evaluation metrics

### Phase 3: Advanced (Future)
- [ ] Building production-ready agents
- [ ] Implementing advanced security measures
- [ ] Creating scalable agent architectures
- [ ] Optimizing agent performance
- [ ] Contributing to the ADK community

## Daily Progress Log

### Day 1: Getting Started
